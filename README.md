# Airlines-Data-Analysis by Alok Ranjan
✈️ Airlines Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of airline industry data to uncover insights into flight performance, delays, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This project leverages Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and visualization.

📊 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on airline datasets

Analysis of flight delays by carrier, airport, and route

Trend analysis for on-time performance over time

Visualization of key metrics (delay causes, distance vs. delay, etc.)

Optional: Machine learning model to predict flight delays

🧰 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

[Optional] Scikit-learn for ML models

CSV or external datasets (e.g., BTS or Kaggle sources)
